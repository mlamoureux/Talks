# Talks
Some of my research talks, for public view.

Note that some of these display better in Chrome or Safari. Firefox seems to have trouble with math equations, etc. 

Time-Freq-Talk is from 2016, and shows how to do some fairly complex displays in a Jupyter notebook. 
It includes animations, sound output, and the Slideshow display so you can present like a PowerPoint presentation.
